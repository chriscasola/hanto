DELTA HANTO
X Allow players to resign
X Test for game ending in draw
X No round limit in delta
X Ensure walking works correctly
X Crab can walk one hex in a turn
X Sparrow can fly
X No piece can move until butterfly is placed
X Check if pieces need to be adjacent to pieces of the same color

REFACTORING PRE-DELTA HANTO
X Refactor tests into common HantoGameTests
X Refactor GammaHantoGame into AbstractHantoGame
X Ensure HexCoordinate is used throughout the code (don't trust HantoCoordinates that are passed in as they may not override equals)
X Refactor rules into rulesets


GAMMA HANTO
X Allow butterfly to walk one hex (if it is unoccupied)
X Do not allow sparrows to walk
- End after ten turns if the game has not already ended

NICE TO HAVE
X Refactor rules into rulesets



BETA HANTO
X blue moves first by default
X call to initialize() can specify that red moves first
X check adjacency of pieces
X ensure first move is at (0,0)
X butterfly must be on board by 4th turn (if no butterfly, the only legal move for the 4th move is to place it)
X can place sparrows (same abilities as butterfly)
X each player gets five sparrows
X determine when a butterfly is surrounded
X end game with draw if all pieces are placed and no butterfly is surrounded
X make sure each player has one butterfly
X end game if butterflies are surrounded





ALPHA HANTO
X place butterfly on board
X blue moves first
X blue places butterfly at 0,0
X red places butterfly adjacent to blue butterfly
X game ends in a draw
X make sure the correct player moves
X make sure the correct piece is specified
X make sure correct/valid coordinates are passed to makeMove()
